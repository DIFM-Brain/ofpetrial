Suppose you have created a trial design applying `assign_rates()` to experiment plots made by `make_exp_plots()`, but you are not quite satisfied with it and would like to change rates here and there. You can easily do so manually. This vignette demonstrates such operations. 

# Data Preparation 

Let's first create a trial design for a single input case.

```{r}
n_plot_info <-
  prep_plot_f(
    input_name = "NH3",
    machine_width = 30,
    section_num = 1,
    harvester_width = 20,
    headland_length = 30,
    side_length = 60
  )

exp_data <-
  make_exp_plots(
    input_plot_info = n_plot_info,
    boundary_data = system.file("extdata", "boundary-simple1.shp", package = "ofpetrial"),
    abline_data = system.file("extdata", "ab-line-simple1.shp", package = "ofpetrial"),
    abline_type = "free"
  )

n_rate_info <-
  prep_rate(
    plot_info = n_plot_info,
    gc_rate = 180,
    unit = "lb",
    rates = c(100, 140, 180, 220, 260),
    design_type = "ls",
    rank_seq_ws = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
    rank_seq_as = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  )

td <-
  assign_rates(
    exp_data = exp_data,
    rate_info = n_rate_info
  )
```

Here is what the trial design looks like.

```{r}
viz(td, type = "rates", abline = FALSE)
```

# Changing rates 

It is important to be aware that every single plot is assigned a withint-strip plot id and a strip id when they were created using `make_exp_plots()`. 

```{r}
td$trial_design[[1]]
```

The figure below shows the strip id associated with each plot.
```{r, fig.height = 9}
viz(td, type = "strip_id")
```

The figure below shows the plot id associated with each plot.
```{r, fig.height = 9}
viz(td, type = "plot_id")
```

As you can see, `plot_id` is the unique numeric identifier assigned to each of the plots **within** a strip. So, there are multiple plots with the same `plot_id` values, but a combination of `strip_id` and `plot_id` uniquely identifies a plot.

## By plot

You can use `change_rate_by_plot()` to change rates. The code below change the rate asscociated the plot with `strip_id = 1` and `plot_id = 1` (left bottom cell) to 0.

```{r}
modified_td <- 
  change_rate_by_plot(
    td,
    input_name = "NH3",
    strip_ids = 1,
    plot_ids = 1,
    new_rate = 0
  )
```

```{r}
viz(modified_td, type = "rates", abline = FALSE)
```

You can change rates of multiple plots with the same `plot_id` across multiple `strip_id`s.

```{r}
change_rate_by_plot(
  td,
  input_name = "NH3",
  strip_ids = 1:10,
  plot_ids = 10,
  new_rate = 0
) %>%
viz(abline = FALSE)
```

When you give vectors of values to `stip_ids` and `plot_ids`, the plots with all the possible combinations of `strip_id`-`plot_id` are going to have a new rate.

```{r}
change_rate_by_plot(
  td,
  input_name = "NH3",
  strip_ids = 1:10,
  plot_ids = c(1, 5, 9, 14, 19, 24),
  new_rate = 0
) %>%
viz(abline = FALSE)
```

## By strip

`change_rate_by_strip()` lets you change the rate of all the plot in the strips you specified. When you supply vectoros of equal length to `strip_ids` and `new_rates`, then **n**th element of `strip_ids` is matched with **n**th element of `new_rates`.

```{r}
change_rate_by_strip(
  td,
  input_name = "NH3",
  strip_ids = c(1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19),
  new_rates = seq(0, 270, length = 7)
) %>%
viz(abline = FALSE)
```

If you supply a single value to `new_rates` while supplying more than one values to `strip_ids`, the single rate will be assigned to all the strips specified in `strip_ids`.

```{r}
change_rate_by_strip(
  td,
  input_name = "NH3",
  strip_ids = c(1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19),
  new_rates = 0
) %>%
viz(abline = FALSE)
```

The `change_rate_by_strip()` function can be useful when you want to "remove" some plots from the experiment. For example, take a look at this trial design.

```{r}
data(td_curved)
viz(td_curved, abline = FALSE)
```

Notice that there is a three-plot strip at the east end of the field. Suppose, you can "remove" it from experiments (there is nothing wrong with keeping them as part of the experiment). You can do so by assining the rate for the non-experimental part of field (which is `r td_curved$gc_rate`) to the strip. 

```{r}
change_rate_by_strip(
  td_curved,
  input_name = "NH3",
  strip_ids =31 ,
  new_rates = 180
) %>%
viz(abline = FALSE)
```

## By block

By default, experiment plots made using `make_exp_plots()` are not assigned block IDs. You can do so using `add_blocks()`.

```{r, fig.height = 9}
td_with_blocks <- add_blocks(td)

viz(td_with_blocks, type = "block_id")
```

Let's set the rate for block of `block_id == 1` at 0.

```{r}
td_with_blocks <- change_rate_by_block(td_with_blocks, input_name = "NH3", block_ids = 1, new_rates = 0)

viz(td_with_blocks)
```
