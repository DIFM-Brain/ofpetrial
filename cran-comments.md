## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release. There will be two NOTEs when R CMD check is run. One of them is about a non-standard file created. The `make_trial_report()` function creates an HTML file named "trial_design_report.html". Running an example for this function creates an HTML file, which is recognized as a non-standard tile.
